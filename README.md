# FP

A simple functional programming language in 130 lines of code with `functions as first-class citizens`. $\mathbb{F}_p$ also denotes the finite field of order $p$ 

## HOW TO USE?

- A go REPL is available by running `go run cmd/repl/main.go`

- A experimental web REPL is available in `web_repl` or [https://nextbite12302.github.io/fp/web_repl/](https://nextbite12302.github.io/fp/web_repl/) (cannot handle `ctrl+c` and `ctrl+d`, cannot use `print` for obvious reasons)

- a simple program `example.lisp`

- hello world ! `echo '(print "hello world!")' | go run cmd/repl/main.go 2> /dev/null`

Have fun 🤗

## MANUAL

- for builtin modules, extensions, see `MANUAL.md`

### SPECIAL SYMBOLS
- wildcard symbol: `_` is a special symbol used in `case` to mark every other cases
- unwrap symbol: `*` is a special symbol to unwrap a list, for example `(add 1 2)` is equivalent to `(add * (list 1 2))` 

## COMMON QUESTIONS

- How to handle infix operator? 

translate `[<expr_1> <name_1> <expr_2> <name_2> <expr_3>]` into `(<name_1> <expr_1> (<name_2> <expr_2> <expr_3>))` - 
I don't have any plan implementing this

- Isn't `(let x 3)` equivalent to `(let x (lambda 3))`?

yes, if functions are pure, then we can consider `(let x <expr>)` as a pure function of the form `(let x (lambda <expr>))`. 
however, if functions are not pure, if `x` is defined locally, `(let f (lambda (x + 3)))` and `let f (x + 3)` are different
since variables are evaluated at definition but functions are only evaluated when it is called,
that is if we pass `f` outside of the function, it no longer valid.
in the code below, i gave an example with `(let x_v (print 2 5))` and `(func x_f (print 2 6))`

- How to handle higher-order functions?

implemented

- Tail call optimization

implemented

- Parallel map

WIP - Just need to make a copy of the last frame, invoke functions in parallel

- Parallel everything

if we assume functions are pure, one can consider the whole program as a set of expressions (with some dependencies of `let`)
each function call only need its own variable scope, they can execute every expression at the same time (possibly with some waiting for `let` statement) - 
this is a very interesting idea, but I don't think it's easy to implement

## But can it run Doom?

no 😅
